description: Run a spec-driven autonomous development loop. Picks the next task, implements it test-first, verifies, commits, and repeats. Use when you want to implement a feature, start coding, run the loop, build from the spec, or continue working on tasks. Also use when the user says continue, resume, keep going, or starts a new session on a project with pending tasks. Supports "implement next N tasks" — if the user specifies a count, stop after that many tasks.
