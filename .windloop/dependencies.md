# Spec Dependencies

Declare cross-spec dependencies here. A spec cannot start its loop until
all of its prerequisite specs are fully complete (all tasks `[x]`).

## Format

```
<spec> -> <prerequisite_spec>
```

Arrows point from the dependent spec to its prerequisite.
Multiple prerequisites are listed on separate lines.

## Dependencies

<!-- Add dependencies below. Example:
api -> auth
dashboard -> api
dashboard -> auth
-->
